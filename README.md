# Left Right Center Dice

The program plays through the entirety of a game called Left Right Center Dice and prints out the winner and ending point values.

The user is asked to input the number of players, the program then creates that amount of randomly named players using the associated 'names.txt' file and begiuns the game with a randomly chosen player from the list.

I received this game as a stocking stuffer for Christmas 2022 and, upon reading the rules and finding that players can make no decisions which meaningfully impact the outcome of the game, I thought this was an excellent candidate for automation.

## How to Play Left Right Center Dice
1. Give three chips to each player
2. Player 1 rolls one dice for each chip in their posession
3. Rolling "Left" means the player passes a chip to the left. Rolling "Right" means the player passes a chip to the right. Rolling "Center" means the player places a chip in the center. Rolling "O" means the player keeps their chips
4. Player 1 passes the dice to the player on their left (Player 2)
5. Players may continue even after losing chips as another player may pass chips to them
6. Play continues until only one player has chips remaining
7. The last player wins the chips in the center
