# left_right_center

The program plays through the entirety of a game called Left Right Center Dice and prints out the winner and ending point values.

The user is able to input the number of players, names of which are randomized from 'names.txt'

I thought this would be a fun and easy coding project given that the game is entirely based on chance (the players can make no decisions which meaningfully impact the outcome of the game).
